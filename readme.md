## Features
This plugin adds a team management page for WooCommerce customers to import other users. I mainly built this plugin as a template for clients that want to purchase content that will be restricted or limited by being purchased. Users usually want to buy content for their employees or students. This plugin allows one main person for example a "team leader" or teacher to manage multiple users.
